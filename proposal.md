# Proposal

This project is a functional, complete implementation of a blockchain (directly inspired by Bitcoin's blockchain) written in Golang. Not only does it showcase the robust power of a strongly typed language for a cutting-edge application, but it can also be used by the company as the basis for its new cryptocurrency.
